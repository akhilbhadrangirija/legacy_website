            The first phase includes 100 senior-friendly apartment units designed for comfort and safety. Only 25% of the land is used for buildings; the rest is dedicated to greenery and outdoor amenities. The project is not profit-driven but created as a humanitarian, self-sustaining community.

            It provides luxurious accommodation, lifestyle amenities, and compassionate care — all to ensure a contented life for senior citizens. Residents lease an apartment for a minimum of 10 years, with full rights of use and the option to renew. The community is secure, self-contained, and designed to provide freedom and peace of mind.
